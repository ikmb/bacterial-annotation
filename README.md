# Bacterial-annotation pipeline

This pipeline performs annotation of bacterial genome assemblies. The inputs are expected to represent complete or near-complete assemblies. This workflow has not been tested on highly fragmented metagenome assemblies - but might work
for this purpose as well. 

For information on how to run this pipeline, see the below.
